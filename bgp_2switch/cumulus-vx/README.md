## Topology

This is the simplest BGP sandbox environment.  
There are 2 switches and 2 servers.  
And the switches distribute each directly connected route to the another switch using BGP.

## Usage

### 1. Create Virtual Environment

```
$ vagrant up
```

### 2. Delete Virtual Environment

```
$ vagrant destroy
```

### 3. Show Configurations

Login to the `switch01` or `switch02`.

```bash
$ vagrant ssh switch01  # (or switch02)
```

Show route.

```bash
$ sudo net show route
show ip route

Show BGP neigbor.  
`BGP state = Established` means BGP peering session is successfully established between `switch01` and `switch02`.
